# OOP in Java

This very interesting repository contains the tasks for a course of OOP in Java. Unfortunately, for the course purposes the variables in
the programs are in Polish.  
Although one can say that the tasks are a bit childish (*c'mon, a task about Santa Claus?*), they thaugh me a lot and showed me how to think in the categories of Object Oriented Programming.
